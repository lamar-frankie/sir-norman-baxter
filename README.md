### Feeding

Sir Norman's body is a temple; a performance temple; a glorious performance temple. In order to maintain his physique and the energy levels required for his life style, Sir Baxter requires 2 quality feedings per day. 

**First feeding:**

- 1 cup of dry dog food

- bowl of water

**Second feeding:**

- 1 cup of dry dog food mixed with one packet of wet dog food

- bowl of water (2 or 3 cups is fine)

### Privy

**Scheduled:**

- Sir Baxter likes to go number 1 as soon as you get up.

- Sir Baxter appreciates if you take him to go number 1 before you go to bed. 

- Sir Baxter will most likely need to use the Privy **20-25 minutes after eating**.

**Unscheduled:**

Sir Baxter may need to visit the privy intermittently. He will most likely indicate this by sniffing furniture or banisters. When this happens it means he needs to go immediately. 

### Walking

Sir Baxter is a natural explorer and very inquisitive about his environment. Unfortunately, he is still recovering from his heart condition. **This means his walks should be:**

- at a slow pace

- no more than 10 minutes

### Treats

Sir Baxter is always a "good boi", but sometimes he is an even "gooder boi". When you feel that Sir Baxter is being a "gooder boi" you may reward him with treats from his treat bag as often as you like. 

### Sleeping

Sir Baxter will try and sleep with you. He may try to jump in the bed with you. If you are okay with this then so is he. He you are not okay with this remove him from the bed and say firmly, but gently "No". When Sir Baxter is convinced you really mean it. He will stop trying to jump into the bed.

**(Optionally)** You may crate Sir Baxter when you are ready for bed if you choose. 

### Crating

If you plan to leave Sir Baxter alone for more than an hour, he should be crated. If you choose not to crate Sir Baxter anything left on your tables and counter tops is fair game.
